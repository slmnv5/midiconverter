; Every incoming messages goes trough the list of rules from top to bottom
; Semicolon starts a comment that goes to the end of the line
; Rule has three parts separated by '='
; If a MIDI message matches first part, it is converted by the second part, the third part specifies rule type
; Three rule types are 's' - stop rule, 'p' - pass rule, 'c' - count rule.

; Stop rule and count rule stop scanning rules if match is found
; For pass rule newly converted message goes throgh remaining rules


; First part matches event by type, channel and two MIDI values. Example: 'n,,10,20' - Note, any channel, note number 10, velocity 20.
; Second part describes converted message. Example: 'n, ,20, ' - Note, same channel, note number 20, same velocity
; Missing values in the first part mean that rule matches any value (e.g. any channel)
; In the second part it keeps the value without changes (e.g. keep same channel)
   
; Four MIDI message types are: n-note on/off (on/off depends on note velocity), p-program change (PC), c-control change (CC), a-any type
; MIDI channel is number in the range 0:15. MIDI values are numbers in the range 0:127 

; Examples of 1st part of a rule:
; 'n,2,30:40,1:127' - matches note ON channel 2, note number 30:40, any velocity   
; 'n,2,30:40,0' - matches note OFF channel 2, note number 30:40, velocity must be zero fo note OFF   
; 'c,,,120:127' - matches CC on any channel (0:15), any control number (0:127), and control value 120:127   

; Example of 2nd part of rule:
; 'c,2, , ,' - convert to CC on channel 2, keep MIDI values the same
; 'n,15,,20' - convert to note ON channel 15, the same MIDI value for note number, velocity 20

; Example of complete rule:
; n,,,0:5=n,0,0,0=s; all quiet notes silenced, stop scanning remaining rules  
; n,,,101:127=n,2,,=s; all loud notes sent to channel #2, stop rule 
; a,,,,,=n,0,0,0=s; catch any event and convert to a zero note off



; CC 12 to note 12 ON/OFF
c,0,12,0:70=n,,12,77=p; CC small value to note ON   
c,0,12,127:127=n,,12,0=p; CC max value to note OFF 

; CC 13 to note 13 ON/OFF
c,0,13,0:70=n,,13,77=p   
c,0,13,127:127=n,,13,0=p

; count notes
n,0,12,=n,,40,=c      
n,0,13,=n,,60,=c      
n,0,60,=n,,80,=c; count note 60    
n,0,62,=n,,90,=c  
n,0,64,=n,,100,=c  
n,0,65,=n,,110,=c

; any other pass as is, without this rule it will be blocked
a,,,,=a,,,=p
