; Below are rules to check incoming MIDI messages and convert them to other messages.
; Every incoming messages is applied to list of rules.
; Rules are searched from top to bottom, and they are stripped from empty characters
; and comments. Semicolumn starts a commentary that goes to the end of line

; If a message matches first part of a rule, it is converted as described by second part of the rule.
; Rule parts are separated by '=' or '>'
; With separator '>' - the rule is terminating, checking rules stops if match is found
; With separator '=' - the rule is not terminating, newly converted message is applied to remaining rules

; First part of rule matches event by type, channel and  2 MIDI values e.g. 'n,5,10,20'
; Second part describes converted message e.g. 'n,6,20,30'
; Message types are few: n-note on, o-note off, p-program change, c-control change, a-any type
; MIDI channel is number in range 0-15. Two MIDI values are numbers in range 0-127 

; Examples of 1st part of rule:
; 'n,2,30:40,120:127' - matches note on channel 2, note number 30-40, velocity 120-127   
; 'c,,,120:127' - matches control on any channel, any control number, CC value 120-127   

; Example of 2nd part of rule:
; 'c,2, , ,' - convert message to CC on channel 2, keep two MIDI values the same
; 'n,15,,20' - convert to note on channel 15, the same MIDI value for note number, velocity 20


n,,0:50,>n,2,22,22; catch left side notes
o,,0:50,>o,2,22,22; catch left side notes
n,,51:127,0:127>n,3,33,33; catch right side notes
a,,,,,>n,0,0,0; finally catch any event and convert to a dumb note
