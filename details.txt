Rule is a single line in text file, extra spaces are removed  
Semicolon starts a comment that goes to the end of the line
Every incoming MIDI event goes trough the list of rules from top to bottom.

Rule has parts separated by '='. Example: 'c,0,12,0:70=n,,12,77=p'
If a MIDI event matches first part, it is converted to match second part. 
The last part is rule type as explained below.

Conversion rule types are: 's' - stop, 'p' - pass, 'o' - once, 'k' - kill 
Count rule type is: 'c' - count

For rules Pass and Once converted event is passed to the remaining rules.
For Count, Stop and Kill rules processing stops if a match for the event is found.

Kill rule simply removes the matching event.
Once rule makes conversion only if event is different from the previous, thus for few identical events only first is converted others are ignored.

Count rule counts number of notes in series. Series is sequence of the same note arriving less than 0.6 seconds apart.
It adds number of notes in series, adds 5 if the last note was released with a delay and set velocity of note to that value.


Examples of conversion rule:

n,2,30:40,1:127=c,2,,,=p 
;note ON channel 2, note number 30:40, any velocity = convert to CC on channel 2, keep MIDI values the same = pass to next rule

c,,,120:127=n,15,,20,=s 
;CC on any channel (0:15), any control number (0:127), value 120:127 = convert to note ON channel 15, 
;keep same MIDI value for note number, velocity 20 = stop, do not scan remaining rules

;Less verbose rule description
n,,,1:5=n,0,0,0=s; all quiet notes silenced, stop scanning remaining rules  
n,,,101:127=n,2,,=p; all loud notes sent to channel #2, scan remaining rules using converted note 
a,,,=n,0,0,0=s; catch any event and convert to a zero note off, stop rule
a,,,=a,,,=s; any message passed as is, without changes
n,,,=n,,,=k; any note is killed
c,,,=c,2,,=s; any CC is moved to channel 2
n,1,,0=c,0,7,0=s; all note OFF on channel 1 convert to CC 7 value zero on channel 0 

Example of count rule:
n,0,12,=c; this counts note 12.
Double tap will create new note 12 with velocity = 2. Double tap and hold velocity = 2+5 = 7, etc.
Count rule does not send note OFF only note ON
