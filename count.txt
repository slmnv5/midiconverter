; Why do we need to count incoming MIDI messages just to create other messages?
; This may be useful for most MIDI controllers that have few buttons but need to send many messages.
; With counting number of possible messages is increased many times.

 
; Application counts similar notes with the same channel and the same note number.
; When count is over application sends new note equal to:
; mapped note + number of counted note ON messages + 5 if the last note OFF was delayed.
; If a similar note does not arrive in 0.6 seconds or some other note arrives the count stops.

; Examples:
; double tap on note 60 will send counted note: 60 + 2 = 62 
; double tap on note 60 with a hold at the end will send note:  60 + 2 + 5 = 67
; triple tap of note 60 with a hold at the end will send note:  60 + 3 + 5 = 68
; In every example note 60 is sent as well but only one time.
